## How to use our Software
1. Installation Documentation
You could install 'IDLE' to run this program. Then download the file, insert it into a directory in which you will be running the program from. Then just simply run the program and follow on screen instructions. If you are able to see the first instruction of "What is your name?" then IDLE is installed and the program is being executed. Otherwise, check that the installation was complete and the program directory is accurate.
